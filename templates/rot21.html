<p class="warning">Haha, you used ROT21? Really?</p>
<p>You're the kind of hacker who thinks 'npyj' is a type of martial art.</p>
<p>Your code is so bad, even Xgdkkt refuses to help.</p>
<p>You tried to hack the kgvizo but ended up formatting your own drive.</p>
<p class="glitch">Oops, system failure. Just kidding. Try again.</p>
<p>Your nxmdkon are slower than a dial-up connection in 1997.</p>
<p>If dbijmvixz were an exploit, you'd be zero-day.</p>
<p>You're the mzvnji why 'turn it off and on again' is step one.</p>
<p>Hint: Youâ€™re moving in the wrong direction.</p>
