<p class="warning">Haha, you used ROT20? Really?</p>
<p>You're the kind of hacker who thinks 'moxi' is a type of martial art.</p>
<p>Your code is so bad, even Wfcjjs refuses to help.</p>
<p>You tried to hack the jfuhyn but ended up formatting your own drive.</p>
<p class="glitch">Oops, system failure. Just kidding. Try again.</p>
<p>Your mwlcjnm are slower than a dial-up connection in 1997.</p>

<p>You're the lyumih why 'turn it off and on again' is step one.</p>
<p>Hint: Youâ€™re moving in the wrong direction.</p>
