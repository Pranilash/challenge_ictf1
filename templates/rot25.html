<p class="warning">Haha, you used ROT25? Really?</p>
<p>You're the kind of hacker who thinks 'rtcn' is a type of martial art.</p>
<p>Your code is so bad, even Bkhoox refuses to help.</p>
<p>You tried to hack the okzmds but ended up formatting your own drive.</p>

<p>Your rbqhosr are slower than a dial-up connection in 1997.</p>
<p>If hfmnqzmbd were an exploit, you'd be zero-day.</p>
<p>You're the qdzrnm why 'turn it off and on again' is step one.</p>
<p>Hint: Youâ€™re moving in the wrong direction.</p>
